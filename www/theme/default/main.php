   <img class='topimg' src='/img/me_sm.jpg' />This is me. I've been a software developer, creating connected applications since the mid 80's. I've worked with a multitude of languages over the years from cobalt right up to Go. The ones I've spent the most time with are C and PHP. I've been working with PHP since version 1.
